## 🔬 About The Lab

The **Mohanty Lab** at Penn State University is pioneering the intersection of **microbiology, metabolomics, and data science** to unlock the biochemical conversations between microbes and human health. Led by **Dr. Ipsita Mohanty**, our research explores how trillions of microbes living inside us pull the biochemical levers that shape our metabolism, immunity, appetite, cognition, and even mood.

### 🎯 Our Mission

We are pulling back the curtain on the hidden "Wizard of Oz" — the microbiome — by mapping the **enzymes, metabolites, and host receptors** that explain how microbes influence health. Our goal: to tune that dialogue and discover modifiable levers for human wellness.

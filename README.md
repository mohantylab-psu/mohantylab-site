## 🔬 About The Lab

The **Mohanty Lab** at Penn State University is pioneering the intersection of **microbiology, metabolomics, and data science** to unlock the biochemical conversations between microbes and human health. Led by **Dr. Ipsita Mohanty**, our research explores how trillions of microbes living inside us pull the biochemical levers that shape our metabolism, immunity, appetite, cognition, and even mood.

### 🎯 Our Mission

We are pulling back the curtain on the hidden "Wizard of Oz" — the microbiome — by mapping the **enzymes, metabolites, and host receptors** that explain how microbes influence health. Our goal: to tune that dialogue and discover modifiable levers for human wellness.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/pnpm
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mohantylab-psu/mohantylab-site.git
cd mohantylab-site

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Firebase News Setup

The News page reads and writes from Firebase Firestore, uses Firebase Authentication for admin posting, and uploads images to Firebase Storage.

1. Create Firebase Auth user(s) in the Firebase console.
2. Deploy the included Firestore and Storage rules from this repository.
3. Apply the included Storage CORS config for local development uploads.

This repository includes:

- `firestore.rules`
- `storage.rules`
- `firebase.json`
- `.firebaserc`
- `storage.cors.json`

Deploy rules:

```bash
npx firebase-tools login
npx firebase-tools use mohanty-b186b
npx firebase-tools deploy --only firestore:rules,storage
```

Apply Storage CORS (required for browser uploads from localhost):

```bash
gcloud storage buckets update gs://mohanty-b186b.appspot.com --cors-file=storage.cors.json
```

If you do not have `gcloud` installed, install Google Cloud CLI and run `gcloud auth login` first.
